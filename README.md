### **About**
This is a really basic project in Java. I am still learning
the ins and out of the language. The purpose of 
this project is to practice my skills
in Java and computer science concepts. Some of those
concepts include object oriented programming and
data structures and algorithms. My initial goal was 
to code a computer AI into the game to compete
against a player (in this case the user).
After finishing, the game has three game modes.

**1. Player vs. Player**

**2. Player vs. Computer**

**3. Computer vs. Computer***

\*Option 3 always ends in a draw


The game features a postgame menu which features
the following options:


**1. New Game**

**2. Change Game Type**

**3. Display Stats**

**4. Exit**


I might implement a GUI in the future, but I am not sure
as of now.

### **Getting Started**
If you want to run the program, all you need is any Java
compatible IDE to run the code. The game will be played
in the console/terminal window.  

### **What I've Learned**
Since this is my first decent sized java project, I
thought it would be good for me to discuss what I have
learned. First, I learned the importance of structuring
your code/design before programming. I only learned this due
to the fact that I didn't do so and wasted a lot of time moving,
rewriting, and reformatting code. Second, I got some good
practice with classes and working through what was necessary
for each class I created. Third, I learned a new algorithm
I have never used before (minimax algorithm) and got some 
practice using recursion. Finally, I learned to be patient,
calm, and to take things slowly and carefully when I am
having difficulty getting the output I desire. Also, that it
is okay if I don't understand how an algorithm works the first
time.
