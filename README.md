### **About**
This is a really basic project in Java. I am still learning
thi ins and out of the language. The purpose of 
this project is to practice my skills
in Java and computer science concepts. Some of those
concepts include object oriented programming and
data structures and algorithms. My goal is 
to code in a computer AI into the game to compete
against the player (in this case the user).

### **Getting Started**
If you want to run the program, all you need is any Java
compatible IDE to run the code. The game will be played
in the console/terminal window.
